We would like you to create a command line application using C#. This application should implement
some simple rules for validating an order at a fast-food restaurant.

You will want to create objects for the following:
  - Customer
  - Menu Items
    - Fries
    - Soda
    - Burger
  - Combos
    - Multiple Menu Items
  - Orders
    - Combination of Combos or Menu Items
    
Decide on simple criteria to determine if an order is appropriate for a customer:
  - Non-gluten
  - Vegan
  - Halal
  
Create instances of the menu items and combos you decide to use. Then create instances
of customers with different qualities you can test against the items within an order.
Create and assign orders to the customers. Run the rules you have created and output messages
indicating the customer and orders that are invalid based on the criteria you decide on.
